Non-Implemented Features:
    - parent/child relationships amongst HUD elements; this is more the responsibility of the element itself, not
        this mod.  Furthermore, this functionality is complex enough (eg. offset from parent, alignment to parent, etc.)
        that implementing it would either i) produce a smaller, low-quality, incomplete widget system or
        ii) reproduce a large, high-quality widget system which can already be obtained with any number of other
        libraries.  To avoid unnecessary duplication of functionality, we omit this.
